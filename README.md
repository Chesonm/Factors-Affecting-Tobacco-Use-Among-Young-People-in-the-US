## Generate Results
1. Download all our files
2. Run the `rate_map.py` to get the interactable plot that could show how the smoke
rate of states in the US changes these years in 'rate_map.html' file
   - the result should be in `rate_map.html`
3. Run the `main1.py` to get the dictonary of the states that has largest or lowest
overall net change in percentage of total tobacco use that experience the legislation
change within the year of 2011 to 2019. And also get a graph that show the percentage
of tobacco use in those state in each year (from 2011 to 2019)
4. Run the `main4.py` to get a line graph that show the percentage of use of E-Cigarette,
Cigarette and smokeless tobacco in each year in the US from 2011 to 2019.
5. Run the `ML_protection.py` file to see the plot of error versus the test size and
the plot of error versus the depth we go
   - the result should be shown after you run. However, the result will be different by each run.
6. Run the `interaction.py` file to take the survey
   - You will see some questions in the terminal
